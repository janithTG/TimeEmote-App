# TimeEmote-App
To help reduce the negative effects of prolonged screen time, we create a program that detects the amount of time spent on the computer and notifies the user when it's time to take a break. In addition to detect the amount of time spent on the computer, we designed that program to identify the user's emotions and respond accordingly.
